# BoardGameGeek for Android
This is an unofficial BoardGameGeek application for Android.

<a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.boardgamegeek&pcampaignid=MKT-Other-global-all-co-prtnr-py-PartBadge-Mar2515-1'><img alt='Get it on Google Play' src='https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/images/generic/en_badge_web_generic.png' height=70px/></a><br/>(<em>app currently suspended in Google Play Store</em>)

This app searches and syncs data from BoardGameGeek.com. It's not a game itself - it's a reference tool that provides information about board games.

See what's changed in the [Change Log](/CHANGELOG.md).

See what we're planning for on our [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/pRZWIOOv).
